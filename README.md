## Quick Start

```bash
# clone repository
https://github.com/RoshanSureen/dev-connector.git

# Install dependencies
cd dev-connector && npm install

# create a .env file in root of your project
touch .env
```

In the .env file create the below 2 enviroment varieables. Make sure it is exactly as shown below. No special charecters or spaces must be there.

```
DB_URL=YOUR_OWN_MONGO_URI
TOKEN_SECRET=YOUR_OWN_SECRET
```

To run the development server:

```bash
# the development server runs on port 3000
npm run dev
```

To run production build:

```bash
# create code bundle
npm run build

# run production server
npm run prod
```

In the project a `Procfile` has also been provided. This file is used by Heroku.

### To deploy this project to heroku see steps below:

You will need to install the [heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

```bash
# Heroku-cli (paste link in browser)
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
```

Afer installing heroku-cli run the following commands in terminal

```bash
# login locally
heroku login
```

You will be prompted to enter your email and password which is the same the email and password used when you sign up for Heroku

```bash
# create your app
heroku create

# set enviroment vareiables
heroku config:set DB_URL=YOUR_OWN_DB_URI
heroku config:set TOKEN_SECRET=YOUR_OWN_SECRET
```

Try to keep your production DB different from development DB

```bash
# bundle code for production
npm run build

# deploy code to heroku
git push heroku master:master
```
